# covid_status_page_code

Here is all of the code generating my covid status page.

I open the NZCovidReport/index.qmd and press the Render button. It downloads the needful data using scripts in the additionalScripts folder and generates the graphs, and renders a local website. I look over it, make any needed changes to the document text (not often) then use a console command to render it again and upload it.

This is being provided without the data, as I don't see that I have the rights to onshare sorted out. But anyone is welcome to lookover or borrow the code (MIT licence)
